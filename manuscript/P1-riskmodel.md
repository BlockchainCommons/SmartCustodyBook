# Part One: Risk Modeling #
After that introduction, welcome to the core of #SmartCustody, where we talk about how to secure digital assets.

The heart of this #SmartCustody course is a system of **Risk Modeling**, which allows you to assess the vulnerabilities of your own digital assets, then resolve those vulnerabilities using a system of building blocks that we provide. This first Part explains how the the risk modeling works. The building blocks that are used by this risk modeling system, a cold storage self-custody system and a long detailing of adversaries, then appear in **Part Two** of this book.
