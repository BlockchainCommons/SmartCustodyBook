## What is #SmartCustody?

> _**"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."**_

Our goals:

* To raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary threats.
* To prepare for new custody technologies that break old models for custodianship.

To accomplish these goals, we are creating a series of best-practices white papers and also offering a series of different workshops on these topics. We are additionally collaborating with cryptographic industry and regulatory stakeholders to establish standards, improve best practices, and create new cryptographic key-management and custody technologies.

This is the first of our [#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com) best-practices white papers. To be informed of the release of future best-practices and other educational white papers and to learn about future workshops, subscribe to our email newsletter at [https://tinyletter.com/SmartCustody](https://tinyletter.com/SmartCustody).

## The #SmartCustody Team

[#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com) is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security, and cryptographic research.

The leads for these [#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com) efforts are Christopher Allen ([@ChristopherA](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA)), Shannon Appelcline ([@Appelcline](https://twitter.com/Appelcline)), and Bryan Bishop ([@Kanzure](https://twitter.com/kanzure)). For more information see [Author Bios](#author-bios) at end of this white paper.

The procedures and contents of this white paper have been comprehensively peer-reviewed by a number of experts in the digital-asset ecosystem, including contributors to open-source project like Bitcoin Core and [The Glacier Project](https://glacierprotocol.org/), employees of blockchain technology companies like Blockstream, Ledger, and Tokensoft, and attorneys from a variety of disciplines. We expect to iterate these procedures and update this document regularly as new digital asset technologies and best practices become mature.
