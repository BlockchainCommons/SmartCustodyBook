# Chapter 3

We hope this manuscript contains all the basic things you need to know to get started writing a book using Leanpub-Flavored Markdown.

If you switch to writing in the Markua syntax instead of Leanpub-Flavored Markdown, please be sure to rename the `images` folder in your `manuscript` folder to `resources.`

If there is anything simple that you think we should add, please email us at <hello@leanpub.com>.

We recommend you take a few minutes to explore all the options in the Book Tools menu for your book on Leanpub. We've built a lot of powerful features that can help you write and sell your book!
