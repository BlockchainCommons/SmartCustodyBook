# Part Two: Building Blocks #
This course's risk modeling system is a comprehensive methodology for assessing and resolving vulnerabilities in your digital-asset storage. It takes you through three major stages: asset characterization; risk characterization; and risk resolution. However, it also depends on two further building blocks, which together form the foundation of that risk modeling system.

A **Cold Storage Self-Custody Scenario** is necessary to thoughtfully protect any digital assets that do not need to be kept in a hot wallet. A comprehensive procedure can protect your assets in cold storage, both from attackers and from yourself.

A list of **Adversaries** further details the many vulnerabilities that may exist in your digital-asset-storage system. Lists of case studies, risks, and solutions can all be used to address vulnerabilities that you've identified through risk modeling.
