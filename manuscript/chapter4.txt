{words: 500}
? Why do you think the first version of the Markua spec took so long?

Look at the Leanpub website and read the [pricing essay](https://leanpub.com/pricing).

! Answers could include "bootstrapped startup", the spec evolving, removing HTML mapping, etc.

That's it for this quiz, and this MOOC!
