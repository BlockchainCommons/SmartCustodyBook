# #SmartCustody!

Your digital assets are more vulnerable you might think.

They could be stolen by hackers, extorted by the mob, expropriated by the government, or lost by you!

_#SmartCustody_ details the "Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets". It's what you need to ensure that you don't lose your Bitcoins, your Ether, or your self-sovereign identity.

_#SmartCustody_ teaches you how to protect your digital data and cryptocurrencies with procedural solutions. A risk-modeling methodology leads you through the process of sketching out your digital-asset processes, identifying your vulnerabilities, determining your true risks, and correcting those dangers. It's built upon a 14-step cold-storage scenario and a set of 27 personified adversaries. Case studies help to make the adversaries real, and identify both abstract and historic attacks for each.

Though this book lays its foundation upon the simplest level of self-custodianship, later sections describe how to use the risk modeling techniques (along with the cold-storage scenario and the adversaries list) to be a Smart Custodian if you're a fiduciary.

If you're a small Bitcoin holder, a cryptocurrency trader, or a fund manager, _#SmartCustody_ can offer you procedural techniques and adversarial insights to improve the security of your digital assets.
