_Also, thanks to 3Blue1Brown who has created an excellent [*YouTube video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY) on how to think about large numbers. We borrowed his process, but adapted it in our own way. Any understanding comes from his approach, while any mistakes in calculation are ours._
