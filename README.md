# Blockchain Commons SmartCustody Book

The first **SmartCustody Book** focuses on a risk-modeling exercise, which teaches digital-asset holders to itemize their assets, assess vulnerabilities, and resolve those problems. It does so using the foundation of a robust 14-step cold storage self-custody scenario and a set of 27 personified adversaries who may be trying to steal your digital goods. Though this first book is focused on a self-custodian scenario, it also discusses fiduciary duties and demonstrates how the risk-modeling exercise may be used for the more complex scenario of a family fund. Future SmartCustody releases will expand on dual-control, multisignatures, and other SmartCustody technologies required for custodianship models of that sort.
