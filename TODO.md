# SmartCustody v2.0

v2.0 of the Smart Custody book will generally expand the book to include new hardware solutions and also to provide new solutions for multisignatures.

## New Topics

**New Hardware Wallets.** A new Chapter Three will offer variable options for Hardware Wallets, currently planned to include KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor. These will cleanly slot into the middle of the cold-storage procedure. A short article will also discuss deciding among the hardware wallets. This will also require a revision of the scenario section, which will allow us to more cleanly divide the core scenario, the Hardware Wallets, and the optional steps.

**New Multisignatures.** A new PART will discuss multisignatures, first detailing why they're important and how to use them, then providing a variant of the core procedure for using multisignatures in a self-sovereign methodology. An open question for this section is: do we present it as a modification to the base scenario, or as its own scenario; this question will resolve itself as we write the scenario.

**Fidicuiary Multisignatures.** Finally, we combine the lessons learned above to offer our first complete fiduciary scenario, using multisignatures to ensure separation of duties.

## Updated Table of Contents

Obviously this table of contents is subject to change. In particular, wer're considering moving the risk modeling to later in the book to make it more approachable.
